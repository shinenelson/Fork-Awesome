## Requesting New Icons

New icons mostly start as [icon requests] by the Fork Awesome community on
GitHub. Want to request a new icon? Here are some things to keep in mind:

1. Please be nice. {{ site.forkawesome.name }} is a happy place.
2. Please go through [existing icon requests] if it already exists. If a
   request is found, please add a üëç reaction to that one.
3. Please make requests for single icons, unless you are requesting a couple
   of strictly related icons (e.g., thumbs-up/thumbs-down).
4. Please include the following :
   - Title your [new issue] `Icon request: icon-name` (e.g., `Icon request: icon-car`)
   - Include a few use cases for your requested icon. How do you plan on using it?
   - Attach a single color image or two that represent the idea you're going for.
5. Request concrete objects: it's harder to make an icon to represent
   happiness, it's easier to make a smiley face. ‚ò∫
